My doctor called United healthcare and gave them the codes for a procedure and the doctor was told it would be covered. So I made the appointment. United healthcare paid the claim and then reversed it citing the codes used as the issue. My doctor has appealed this twice since they used the same codes they initially called about, and United healthcare continues to deny it. I now have to pay for the procedure out of pocket. That cost is $800. Issue 2. I was in physical therapy and when my physical therapist's office called about the number of visits, they were never told of the policy that they had to submit a request for more visits at visit 21. The max you are allowed is 25 and apparently I went over by 1. United healthcare is denying my 26th visit citing their policy.

I pay almost $800 a month for this insurance. I've been denied two other prescriptions from them, which upset me, but I dealt with it. My doctor prescribed a medication for osteoporosis and it took the girls at the office several days and hours to get it pre-approved with my insurance company. Once they finally approved it they said it had to be mailed to the doctor's office. The doctor's office will not be responsible for patient medications being delivered to them. I was told it would be a $60 deductible, which I didn't have a problem with because it's one shot every 6 months. I called to give my credit card information to have it mailed to me and was told my insurance company would not honor the $60 copayment as previously stated. They were going to count this as a medical procedure instead of a prescription, which it is. I was on the phone three times for over an hour with them and requested to talk to a supervisor stating it is a prescription it doesn't matter if it's delivered through a syringe, patch, a pill or liquid it is a prescription and it should be covered. They said they were sorry but there was nothing they could do. I think this insurance company is terrible and I would not recommend them to anyone. I am going to do some research and find another insurance company. They don't have any problem collecting $800 a month for me, but then when my doctor prescribes something for me they deny it.

Back in October, I had foot surgery to repair a bad bunion. My doctor chose to do it in a hospital rather than an outpatient facility because that's where he performs surgery. Weeks prior to surgery, I checked with Blue Cross of Florida to determine what my co-pays and any other financial responsibilities would be. They told me the facility fee would be my co-pay, the doctor's fee would be my co-pay and the anesthesia would be covered by insurance as long as the anesthesiologists were in my network and their work was done in a network facility (which the facility was in-network). I asked if there were any other fees and they said no. Back in June, I had sinus surgery done in an outpatient facility and these fees were the same so it all seemed to make sense. Fine. The facility also confirmed my co-pay a few days prior to surgery and when I asked if there would be any further fees, they told me no. So, imagine my surprise a couple of months after surgery when I receive a bill from the hospital for approximately $4,500. I called Blue Cross of Florida right away and asked them what this was about. It turns out this is my 30% responsibility for surgical implements, tools, etc. used during surgery (including band-aids!). Long story short, I appealed the claim, explaining I did my due diligence and called them and the facility and was never told of this supposed 30% responsibility. They said they looked into it and denied my appeal. They say they told me on the tape recording, but they never offered to let me hear it. And I know they never told me it. Now, I am stuck with this $4500 bill, which I cannot afford to pay. I am disgusted with Blue Cross of Florida and insurance in general.", "grade": "1", "extrac_date": "2022-04-04 08:37:28"},

Her bills were almost a million dollars, but with immediate write offs due to Anthem's negotiated contracts. She had two separate bills: One for the regular hospital and one for the mental hospital. The regular hospital bill was largely paid for, with a relatively small amount left to pay. The mental hospital bill, however, was only 72% paid for, with the other 28% requiring payment.  My family member had been slowly making progress in the mental hospital, with electro-convulsive treatment (ECT), recovering from both catatonia and severe depression, as measured in part by ongoing PHQ scores. Anthem's medical director had been denying payments for some of her treatments, but Langley Porter had appealed these denials and obtained payment, as they are, after all, the experts. My family member was ultimately discharged with a PHQ score of 14, abnormal, suggesting moderate to moderate-to-severe depression.

After several weeks of research and firm quotes, I finally decided to go with Florida Blue Select PPO based on a quoted monthly premium of $1522.59.

Beginning on January 1, 2019, Florida Blue without any notice increased my premium basically $140 a month for a new monthly premium of $1663.26. This was done without any notification by mail or e-mail.  My complaint is that after two months under an agreed to premium of $1522.59 per month, Florida Blue without any notice significantly increased my premium. In the initial negotiations in September 2018 with Florida Blue Sales Representatives they clearly made it seem as if my premium would be $1522.59 for at least a year but to my surprise, after only two months, I get this $140 increase per month which I cannot afford.

Can barely eat. Even have to turn my toothbrush sideways to get it in my mouth. I am in constant pain. My oral surgeon has been trying to deal with the third party company that UHC sublets the MRI pre-Auths to for months to get approval. They keep denying it. Saying I don\u2019t meet the criteria. I\u2019m progressively getting worse. But UHC has approved a procedure, arthrocentisis, to fix the jaw. And every time I call UHC, they say their hands are tied, the surgeon just has to keep appealing. Ridiculous. Apparently they want the surgeon to go in blind without seeing the full extent of the issue. Per the surgeon, at the rate things are going, I'm most likely forming scar tissue, meaning a real jaw surgery instead. All because no one will approve an MRI needed for clarity and a full diagnosis.

I own the company and this is the policy that I can afford to offer myself and my employees. Before moving to UHC my insurance was a grandfathered policy with BCBSNC from before the ACA. My experience from day one with UHC has been horrible. In the first month after the change in policy UHC deigned most of the medications I was on and wanted me to restart the process of proving alternatives were not an ok choice. A process that I had gone through years before and with BCBSNC to finally reach the meds that worked and had the least side effects. This process literally cost me and the insurance company thousands of dollars as we tried the medications required as \"approved\". Lost time, countless blood test, visits every few weeks to review and make changes only to land back at the original starting point. \"Helping more people live healthier lives\" this the slogan for UHC and is a complete joke. The real slogan is \"Your claim is deigned\". I pay for more procedures and for more medication outside of my health insurance than anyone would believe. I find that most medication can be purchased from small local pharmacies for rates less than my co-pay; something no one at UHC can explain. Most procedures are not covered even after my doctor goes through multiple rounds of authorizations with medical records and facts. Apparently the intern that reviews these knows much more than my doctor. Bottom line is that we all have to have insurance. If you can afford another company avoid UHC.

I was unsuccessful after many attempts. Finally, was told by one of the pediatricians to call another location, which so far we were able to go, but now I\u2019m just crossing my fingers that the service is covered by the insurance.  And since I was unsuccessful on my own to get an ObGYN I then called Anthem for help, hoping they would have another list to give me. I was wrong. The rep said she had a different list but it was worse! After spending 45-1hr with her, still no luck. She ended up suggesting I go to the one PCP I found myself to ask for a referral instead, who can hopefully find someone for me. Seriously?

We were paying this year $1,889.00 per month for a family of 4, so a proper PPO policy, without vision or dental.

When we tried talking by phone with us, he just hung up. NOT recommended! The guy behaves like a criminal. Anthem has happily taken our premiums, (always paid on time) and normally just used their discounts to inform us how much money they have saved us each year, for the couple of doctor visits we actually had each year, which never reached our deductible or out of pocket, so they never had to actually pay anything. Then in 2019, our son needed a hernia operation and my wife had a colonoscopy as a precaution, so we reached, for the first time in 14 years, our deductibles and out of pockets.

I am in horrible pain, and the doctor told me to use it as little as possible. With the denial for a simple diagnostic procedure I am stuck. This is completely unacceptable as I now have to spend weeks fighting this determination. Earlier in the year I had a sinus issue and this time the pre-authorization for the sinus MRI was approved, After the MRI, it was determined that surgery was needed. Again another pre-authorization was submitted and it came back with with allowing for the surgery but disallowing for a technique that is needed to do the job correctly. Without being able to use that technique the doctor told me that there would be too high of a risk of a bad outcome and he was not willing to do it. I have a PPO plan with 4 doctor's visits per year where I only have to pay the CoPay, yet every time I go to a doctor, I get a bill in full and I am told that it is being applied to my deductible. So every time I have to call, wait on the phone for 30 to 45 minutes to tell them that the visit is part of the 4 included. They say sorry and make no correction. If this would happen every once in a while it would be understandable but it happens every time, year after year. It is a big waste of my time.

We have never received anything from the marketplace, after careful consideration we decided not to renew. We took our account off of auto draft. Everything that we received said that we had to put down our first month premium in order for 2018 policy to start. I cancelled the auto draft, wrong. On Jan 1, 2018 an email came saying, \"Thank you for your payment.\" We called them and they said yes it did draft the premium. I asked how when we didn't renew. The customer service rep cancelled our policy as of Dec 31, 2017. He told us we should received a refund in 10 business days. I called back in the middle of month only to be told that it will take 30 days to process our refund. I am very upset. I didn't renew in the first place because we really couldn't afford it. They assure me it's cancelled. I don't like the fact that we can't afford it! Part of the reason we can't is my husband is divorced and pays child support but they include all the money you make. We don't actually see that money. It's not taxable to his ex. I am not saying that part is FL Blue fault but what I am upset about is the prices. If I was able to scrap up the increase in health insurance the plan is useless when I go to use it. Why? Because, I then have to pay for my own doctors visits, first $7300.00, not to mention $7400.00 in yearly premiums before the insurance pays anything. That means I have to pay 14,700.00 before they have to kick in anything. To me that's not affordable. ", "grade": "4", "extrac_date": "2022-04-04 08:37:29"},

In my home state, I was covered under Medicaid but as FL never expanded their Medicaid program, I fell into the coverage gap where I make too much, and too little at the same time -- a situation that many have found themselves in, in the state of Florida or any other states that chose not to expand. Therefore, I pay 265 a month which is technically more than I make since I am a full-time student. This plan has not been accepted anywhere I have tried to receive care. Their customer service is terrible, and there are major discrepancies between the care providers that will accept me according to the website, and then following through contacting these doctors -- low and behold, they do not accept MyBlue. On the website itself, I have been assigned a primary care doctor--but only a name and number are listed. Upon further investigation, the number is to an insurance agency, and not a primary care office. No address, and when I called that number, someone who spoke broken English answered my call, with no greeting. It sounds like this plan is only good for backdoor quality, shady care. I can't fathom how this even qualifies as insurance. Sure, my prescriptions will be $35 a month, and doctor visits are $65... But how good can coverage be if it is not accepted anywhere? So, I have next to useless insurance at an astronomical cost to me personally. It's outrageous that this company can gladly accept consumers money, and then do little to nothing for them.

Free shipping was a benefit, also. The online ordering process was quite simple and understandable for anyone familiar with PC or smartphone processing. Beginning 01/01/2020, that all changed. Though a member can still order by filling out and mailing handwritten orders, or calling an ordering by phone, the online procedure has become much more complicated and lengthy. UHC has partnered with Walmart, so the app sends the member to Walmart\u2019s webpage to select items. Shipping is free with a set minimum $ amount. Rapid delivery is offered, but only on some products, and if a product isn\u2019t available for quick delivery, then it will delay the entire order. The primary problem is that the items appear as jpegs, quite small and difficult to identify for us that have weak eyesight. To determine the exact nature of an item, you have to click on it. Then you have two pages open and must go back and forth between them. Personally, I found myself lost several times and looking at unrelated and non-covered items at Walmart.

I have spent better than 200 hours on the phone with Florida Blue - documenting every call, who I talked to, reference numbers for the calls, people I spoke to, if managers got involved - the whole event. It has been MADDENING! It started in Sept when they separated the bills from medical and dental together to separating them. When I paid for the medical and dental - they were not applying the dental portion to dental. In Oct 2016 I was told I owed 3 months of dental, that I already paid every month along with the medical, but yet CONVENIENTLY the medical did not show a credit for the dental payments applied to medical?!? So the money was missing. Once they discovered this - they credited my medical and I had to pay 3 months to make up for my dental. The following month my medical billing online was ridiculously high. Come to find out they reinstated my son, who was taken off my account (documented) back in April 2016 and made back payments for him - meaning they said I needed to pay for him from April until current?!? I did not add him back on. Then my daughter turned 19 and no longer was covered for dental under our medical insurance so they removed her without letting me know. Then when I called to see why she was not added to our family dental account no one knew how to do it. We spent 2 months trying to add her to our family dental policy. When they did so they also decided to add my son back on as well who is 26 and has insurance through his work and we removed him April 2016.

In the absence of diagnostic evidence, the doctor at Golden Gate Urology, told that 60% of recurrence happened in prostatic bed and recommended radiotherapy (RT) of prostate bed or systemic hormone therapy. After second opinion consultation in Stanford, we found out a clinical trial for a diagnostic technology (MPSA-PET). Through this diagnostic technology, the presence of a single focal metastasis outside of prostate bed was confirmed while the prostate bed itself was negative.  I was supposed to begin focal CT guided radiotherapy in Stanford. The treatment was supposed to last 5 days as opposed to 7 weeks of traditional RT; additionally, it focused to the metastasis rather than blindly applied RT to the prostate bed. 7 weeks RT (with much higher cumulative dose) directed to prostate bed will not do anything to the metastatic development, and will harm the healthy organs in the field. My condition is one of the conditions for which focal treatment can be particularly helpful. Knowing that metastasis is not in the prostate bed, I disagree with accepting RT to the prostate bed.

Blood tests that are FEDERALLY required when you are pregnant (HIV test, other STD panels) they refuse to cover and don't consider it preventative care when in fact it is and is a part of prenatal care. I recently had a genetics test to prepare myself and fianc\u00e9 in case we had to go through what my uncle did, my family is a deletions syndrome carrier as well as Down Syndrome, my fianc\u00e9 is a Down Syndrome carrier as well. Because of the genetic mutations on both sides, my doctor wanted the Natera test done, I was told at most I'd end up paying 200 out of pocket. Ok no biggie.  Imagine my surprise in January when I got a bill for the first set of prenatal tests and panels only to see of 1200 dollars, this garbage insurance company only covered 300, so I had to pay 900 out of pocket for the STD panels and the glucose test. 2 tests that are usually covered by any other insurance company. So over the last week I noticed a denied insurance claim. The Natera test. For the deletion syndrome and the down syndrome. 8,000 dollar bill. Yes, 8 freaking grand! So yesterday I get an email stating they'll pay 3k of it, of the 3k I have to pay 529, and I'm responsible for the remaining 5k. Excuse me? Come to find out that 5 grand won't apply to my out of pocket which my out of pocket max is 4 grand, it also won't apply to my deductible because they consider it \"experimental\".

I was on hold for 20 minutes to get someone who told me that this was not her area and to call another number. On hold again for 20 minutes to be told that they sent a letter out to me that I did not have. She said they would have to send another letter. She said after I receive the letter I could then contact the grievance dept. I asked for the number of that dept. She said there is no number to call. She said you have to write a letter and then wait for them to call you. I asked how long that would take. She said up to 30 Days. What terrible customer service! I am a healthy person and have no reason that I can think of to be denied and can not even find a person to speak to.

Took my wife approximately 6 hours on the phone!!! to get a refund approved. First they said they wouldn't refund us. Are you kidding me they made an error and I have to pay over 600$ for it? So now it will take about a month to get the refund??? What the heck?! It doesn't take a month to take my money but it takes a month to refund it? So we are considering to put a class action lawsuit together since we been told by the market place that Florida Blue did that to a lot of people. They have to reimburse for the hassle and time spend on the phone and for the time I'm unwillingly go without over six hundred dollars that are mine and that I need. That was an unauthorized payment and illegal.

I have been having health issues for months but had to cancel my previous insurance through the marketplace because I just could not afford a $14,500 deductible. I did this in June of 2016. Over a month ago I realized that my family has to have the coverage so I applied through the marketplace again, chose a plan and made my payment. I then went ahead and scheduled needed dr appointments for this month when I \"thought\" I should have coverage. I am still not covered and have been on the phone with various people for weeks and nobody seems to be able to tell me what the problem is. In the meantime the health of myself and my family is deteriorating. I am unable to get coverage after hours of holding on the phone, of being lied to that things will be fixed within a week... It's now the 14th and I still have no coverage and no answers as to why. I try to get my family covered by another insurance company but there are NO OTHER CHOICES!!! This is the absolute worst company I have ever dealt with and I see why there are so many terrible things such as drug abuse in this state! NOBODY can get help! I had gone into the hospitals in the area with severe problems and was sent away without explanation. I cannot get any help and it's just making me worse with all of the stress and waiting. My daughter has been sick and unless I pay a dr for the appt. I can't help her. Yet so many other children are covered and helped. She is a straight A student and can't even get helped.

This plan pays for nothing. The website is completely unreliable. If you go on to find out if a doc or facility is in network, you are wasting your time.

For example, every doc in my GP office has a green check by their name, which means they are in network so I should just have a $10 copay. However, the clerical agency they use to process their claims is considered out of network, so I am not eligible for the $10 copay. I have to pay out of network costs which can be hundreds of dollars. So to clarify - it doesn't matter that the medical professionals who are treating you are in network. What matters is whether or not the paper pushers are in network. Since most medical offices use outside billing agencies located all over the country, Anthem customers are screwed. I think twice about going to the doc as I can't predict ahead of time how much it will cost. This is exactly what Anthem wants. They charge an arm and a leg for premiums - God help you if you miss a payment. They don't pay for anything.

If you need a specialist, you are screwed. I needed surgery to remove screws that were protruding from a metal plate in my wrist. I had the surgery almost 10 years ago, when I had private insurance. I went to my 'primary care' who after one week of extreme pain, referred to me to a doctor who refused to see me. I had to go back to my primary care who, after several days passed, referred me to another doctor who refused to see me. In desperation I went to the emergency room (I made sure hospital was covered by my insurance). They x-rayed me and sent me off to find a doctor - they also refused to help me. One month went by while I was in agonizing pain, I had made calls to my primary care physician at least every other day and no help. I was not even able to get an x-ray (it had to be approved) until I walked into the emergency room. After one month I walked into my primary care's office and was set up with the physician on call (my doctor could not see me). He was horrified by my experience and promised me I would not leave that day without a appointment set up with a surgeon. I did leave without an appointment (after waiting 3 hours in waiting room), but I did get an appointment scheduled the next day. At this point I called Medicare and relayed my story, they gave me a one-time exception to cancel my Anthem Blue Cross advantage plan and I went with traditional Medicare (which I love by the way).

So I needed to make an appointment for a complete physical as I need to teeth extracted and the Oral Surgeon requested I get a physical. Good luck getting an appointment. All doctors are full with patients and existing patients get priority because they are \"established\". I don't know what to do - worried about teeth becoming abscessed but United Healthcare nor the medical group I am enrolled with seem to give a damn.

Normally, a biopsy would be done but I cannot have that procedure as I recently went on blood thinners. UHC doesn't care. They denied the MRI and suggested \"watchful waiting\" until I can have the biopsy done. I'm sure if a UHC executive thought they might have cancer that watchful waiting would not be acceptable.  We appealed the decision and UHC offers two type of appeal processes: one takes about 80 days and the other can take around 6 months. You only get the \"expedited\" appeal (80 days) if your life is threatened. UHC rejected my request for an expedited appeal. I now must wait up to 6 months for a response. Here's the kicker: I'll be on Medicare in about 5 months and you can bet that UHC has done the math so they'll string me along until I get off their plan so they don't have to pay the claim.

But they do not cover routine visits, and have to be reminded of state mandated coverages (depending on the state you live in). The medical offices are no better because they offer a discount on self pay and charge more if you are covered. But that money is still coming out of our pocket so we might as well be self pay! The reason for my review is that I have noticed something that I want to share. It seems to me that most primary care and hospitals offer a discounted self pay option. If you open an HSA (health savings account) you can put pre-taxed money into the account for medical uses. I am not sure what the tax penalty is for not carrying health care, but it is likely less than the $5,000 you will dump into your health insurance, and you can take the money you would be paying BCBS and put it into your HSA account.

Although his physician spoke with United HealthCare and provided the past information that he has been diagnosed with sleep apnea (he has congestive heart disease also), they will not provide him with the new CPAP machine until he completes a new sleep study. UHC is perfectly fine with my husband going without a CPAP machine, even though he has a solid diagnosis and going without greatly affects his health, for the next several weeks until he can complete a new sleep study. We asked if they could provide one, or if we could get reimbursed, once he completes a sleep study which they have denied. (Keep in mind, our group coverage does cover CPAP machines). The outcome, we are paying $1500.00 for a CPAP machine totally out of our own pocket as my husband cannot go without one for the next several weeks while he awaits a sleep study (which will end up with the same diagnosis.. sleep apnea).

It took me 7 weeks to get a refill, and now today, is another delay of 12 days, to get authorization of a monthly refill. Third time. I have a Notice of Action to refill this prescription through 2/10/17 between FL Blue and Caremark but now they tell me they are no longer covering this drug on ANY plan. Florida Blue is the worst, customer service that transfers you to departments that can't help you and you go in circles. After an hour and a half, some girl told me I had to pick a different plan when re-enrollment comes up.

They will approve Lamictal only (not XR) if I pay a \"Penalty Charge\" of $2443.08 for 1 bottle of 180 pills. No one I know of can pay this. The doctor put in an appeal, which was denied and closed because they did approve Lamictal, but at an enormous price that I cannot pay.

He had been told in the past that UHC would not cover a 90-day supply of a controlled substance; however, a UHC representative told him on the phone last month that a 90-day supply would be covered - IF he ordered through UHC's very own mail order prescription provider, Optum.  As a direct result of that conversation, my boyfriend acquired a 90-day prescription (rather than a 30-day) from his doctor, mailed it in to Optum with an additional payment for overnight delivery, and waited two weeks for their response. When he reached out to them, he found that there was an issue with his address that they had failed to contact him about. After he spent 45 minutes correcting that issue over the phone, he waited another week for his prescription to arrive. It did not. Neither Optum nor UHC reached out to him, so he called again. This time, he was told that the first representative was \"misinformed,\" that he would need a prior authorization from his doctor for the 90-day supply, and that he would either have to get only 30 days of his prescription filled (leaving him 60 days without a daily medication) or pay out of pocket for the 90-day supply.

I am so frustrated by the way they treat patients that have chronic auto immune diseases. I would think that they would pay for procedures done by a Medical Doctor in a hospital to make the patient's chronic illnesses better. Oh No, they make a ruling or a decision based on the procedure being experimental. (Mind you I pulled up their qualifications and I met all of them.) However, they will pay for a huge operation that would cost them thousands more. I do not understand their reasoning or thinking. I would think their concern would be for the patient and their health.  Now after getting the procedure done, I have to appeal their decision and go thru more stress and aggravation making my illnesses flare, making me go to the doctor therefore making the insurance pay out more money. Also, I tried to appeal my case by phone which it says in writing on their website and I was just informed I have to write them to start the appeal process by mail. I call customer service and always get a different answer everytime I call them. Half of them cannot speak English and when I ask them to transfer me I get cut off.

During my first year I had found out that I would need medical care for health issues I wasn't aware of previously, including surgery. Since I had a crappy plan that covered very little I was routing from hospitals to outpatient facilities to more outpatients, to Doctor's offices looking for the Dr. services that could match coverage + facility in order to have the surgery under coverage. The result was that the year went by and already in November I decided to wait until the end of the plan so I could purchase a plan with more coverage. On December 26 I went personally to the Florida Blue's office in Hialeah and purchased an All Co-pay 1565 plan for 509.76 a month. I assumed that I finally got to resolve the surgery and medical care needed since the new plan has a larger coverage. Since my Dr. was available on January 2nd he wanted to operate that day. To start, the plan they sold me was supposed to be active on January 1st 2015, it wasn't the case. Florida Blue would be closed on the 1st and no one would be available to release an authorization on time for my surgery on the morning of the 2nd (I had to be at the hospital at 6 am), they said that the authorization department was starting to work around 9-9:30am and no authorization could be release on a previous working day because it was still December and the policy wouldn't start until January 1st. When I questioned the coverage starting the 1st, they said I would be covered if I needed emergency treatment.

So I move and begin my doctor's visits.  All of a sudden, I receive a statement in the mail saying that Florida Blue will not cover me because I'm out of state and did not receive special permission. I told the people from customer service that I needed permission and asked them if there was anything I needed to do. Their response was, \" You're all set to go\". To make a long story short, I now have over $3000 in medical bills I can't afford and all I can do is write an appeal. There is no one I can speak with directly who can help me with this.

She stated \"that they claimed that she was trying to get onto another site?\" She said, \"I can barely get onto my own site, much less try to get onto another site!\" I absolutely can attest to that, as there were too many phone calls daily that I had to personally make to get my password and access changed daily.

Noting, that due to my disability, traveling is hindered especially for such a distance.  I did file a complaint with the Healthcare Bureau and the Justice department. I have filed a complaint/grievance well over 2 months ago -- I have been contacted by someone in the complaints/grievances department and have have NO LUCK as to finding/seeking dental care therefore have started an appeal process. Frankly, simply appalling to be discriminated against due to my disability and financial status which frankly put, DOES NOT ALLOW ME TO have the ability to seek other healthcare coverage elsewhere.

Background: I had an Anthem BCBS individual PPO policy for 14 years. It was damned good insurance -- saw any doctor I wanted, they paid for pretty much anything (but I paid 20% and so on). $300 deductible and $1500 maximum out of pocket. Good insurance. But it was ** expensive. For me and my wife, $1800 per month by 2014. Well, we got tossed unwillingly into Obamacare and our old policies disappeared. With great misgivings, we signed up for a Silver plan with HealthKeepers. Without subsidies it is still less than half the cost of what we had.

All the stress we felt over whether it'd be a good policy now seems like wasted anxiety.

When November came I received a statement stating that I would be covered by Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield. I was very confused because I kept receiving additional letters from Anthem but yet had not received an insurance card or any other form of communication from them in regards to an actual policy number. When I utilized the service the very first time based on the letter that I was given told that I can represent it to obtain coverage or services and not be charged I was then charged an additional fee at the doctors office. According to their coverage I was not supposed to be paying any out of pocket expenses.  I finally received a bill along with an insurance card. The bill told me that because of my financial situation I was only responsible for a 12 dollar a year premium. By the way I am a single mother of four with no additional income making less than $10,000 a year as well as not receiving any type of child support or other government assistance. So I contact and dumb and I pay my premium over the phone within a matter of 2 months I needed some assistance medically I went to a facility that was inside of the network. According to my coverage guidelines this facility being in my network I was not to pay anything out of pocket, I was not to be billed for anything and all of my prescriptions were to be completely covered.

Anthem even approved 2 extensions of physical therapy for my husband.  Now, almost 1.5 years later, they have denied and reversed all of their payments and say that we owe the full $5K deductible (Blue Shield's portion, not Anthem's) amount first (we already paid Anthem's deductible).

When I talked to United Health Care they told me the following: That to continue to apply this money to my deductible is not fair to the healthy people. If I would just pay it myself and the copay assist plan can reimburse me, then they would apply it to my deductible. That it isn't right that I would reach my out of pocket maximum early in the year and the remainder of my medical/pharmacy benefits would be paid at 100% and that isn't fair.

There has been a good 10+ claims that they have falsely denied. They seriously find problems with everything and try to make it as difficult as possibly for you to get things approved. Suddenly in-network procedures become denied as out of network, and in office procedures are being turned into outpatient services falsely. You HAVE to challenge them. Don't accept denials without digging deeper. Read your document benefits thoroughly. If they won't resubmit your claim, appeal it!!! They will probably deny that too! Then you MUST do an EXTERNAL appeal. Even mentioning that word to them will probably cause them to want to take you more seriously. Finally was able to stop this after my husband saw the same doctor for the same similar issue and we both had blood tests and an X-Ray. His blood test was denied and his X-Ray was accepted. My blood test was covered and my X-Ray was denied. Same office, same types of blood tests and X-Rays. I knew something didn't match up. The first person I talked to said it was \"because one of the blood tests were sent off\".

The company is full of tricks to pay claims. Here are a few: repeatedly denying claims for ridiculous reasons - e.g. Denying payment for my rubella vaccine because it was \"infertility treatment\". After months of phone calls by me and my doctor arguing about this (I was pregnant and not infertile at the time) I gave up and paid.  My 1 year old son had a medical emergency and had to be taken by ambulance to the nearest hospital. They denied coverage for the ambulance because it was out of network (sorry I had no choice when I called 911) then they denied coverage of the emergency room doctor's portion of the bill because they were out of network. I spent hours fighting this and writing the insurance commissioner about it and go nowhere. I found out that all emergency medicine doctors in the 4 hospitals in my area had refused to take Anthem because they slow pay so I actually have no option for in-network emergency care.

It has been getting worse for a decade now. Today, October 28, 2014 we were told there would be a 27% increase in our premiums. Yep, 27%. We saw the chart how they hadn't raised our rates much the last few years. Well, that is because we were forced to change our plan, or have major rate increases. First it was a small deductible, then a few years later a $3,000 deductible and then last year raised to $5,000 deductible. ONLY SERVING to discourage people from actually using its coverage. I have to pay $720 per month to \"reserve\" a coverage spot. If I actually need to use it, I pay $5,000 per person.  One auto accident not only is awful in the first place, but it would put my family in financial ruins. It was hard enough getting by before, now I have $150 less per month to spend on food, clothing and any other necessity. The things I want to get fixed I haven't in years because it will only put me in more debt. I have to pick: Do I live with the physical pain?

Our insurance broker suggested putting our four kids on a separate private plan, with our oldest daughter (14 at the time) as the subscriber. We chose Anthem for our kids, and it saved us about $600/month. Then Obamacare happened... our small biz insurance was cancelled, rolled to a new plan, cancelled... same with the kids' insurance... And suddenly, we were going to save $400 by putting the kids back on our small biz plan (in about 6 months, the kids' premium went from about $250/month to $600/month, for no reason). So I called Anthem to cancel. Anthem wouldn't talk to me - I am not on the insurance plan. But I pay the premiums and am the legal guardian of the kids on the plan! So I offered to put my daughter on the phone so she could cancel the plan - nope, she's a minor! What??? We make automatic payments, so I told them I'd just refuse their payments through the bank to cancel the insurance. They threatened to send to me to collections and ruin my credit if I did that. I've literally spent hours and hours on the phone trying to resolve this issue, and only managed to speak to a live person 3 times.

My coverage with Anthem began on 01/01/14.  Each month I got the exact same medication at the exact same CVS, and the medication was always a $0 refill. This always struck me as odd, since my Anthem plan usually has a co-pay on medications between $10 and $30. However, since I just started the plan this year, I just thought it was some sort of covered benefit. Yeah, right. So when I went thru the CVS drive-thru and asked for the refill, I was informed that the cost was a fraction over $200. Huh? I went from a $0 per month on a medication to a sudden price of $200? I told CVS that I would come back later after I had talked to Anthem.", "grade": "1", "extrac_date": "2022-04-04 08:37:37"},

I heard a few people at my office had the same sort of issue so it wasn't just a fluke. In March, I got a different strain of the flu and went to my doctor and they stated that I owed $20.00 from last visit. They said they would resubmit because I had paid my co-pay each time.  In April, I got a collection letter from my doctor and now I owed $40. It's not much, but I live on a very tight budget and that is the difference between eating or going without. I emailed customer service at the first of April and never heard anything back from them. I logged into my account today and saw that someone had responded to me 3 weeks later, but she didn't email my email address. The response was just sent to sit on my Messages in account. She stated that my doctor was a specialist which was why the co-pay was $20 more. I have been going to for the last 20 years and he is now and always has been a family practice doctor.

Then, without clarify about the $3,800 bill, instead, she informed me, he overpaid one month premium fee, and his old policy expired by Dec 31. I got confused a bit about this new information. I worried if he is not covered this month since his policy was expired by last month, Dec 31st. Then, she said \"He has new policy and the $306 is for the bill.\" First, I was confused because my husband or I didn't aware that the new policy took over. I start to ask about the new policy. The information she was giving to me was too scattered and I had to figure out what was going on. While I tried to understand the situation, she told me \"Do you need to be explained again?!\" \"I can't talk to you anymore! You have a language barrier problem.\" \"Forget about the $3,800 bill! Just tear it up since it is wrong bill\" (Finally she gave me the answer for my initial question). \"DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING?!?!\" English is not my first language but I don't miss or misunderstand any words she said. If any case she couldn't understand what I said, she can ask me to repeat but perhaps she didn't need to. I assumed she got frustrated that she couldn't explained well to me about whole situation.

If this authorization is not obtained, the medical facility may not be reimbursed for the testing. Unfortunately, United Health Care recently forced my medical assistant to spend valuable office time repeatedly calling to request pre-certification for an outpatient procedure I recommended to the patient. My assistant repeatedly was placed on lengthy telephone holds and for 3 days was unable to obtain an answer. When she was refused a request for peer to peer discussion (conference between the insurance company's clinical director and me the provider), I finally had to inconvenience the patient by referring her to the emergency room to expedite the procedure.  Despite my request for a callback from the clinical director, no call was received. Instead, an approval was faxed to our office overnight without notification.

The individual who answered the phone said that Women's Care clinic was in network and that I was covered and should feel free to proceed with the mammogram; however, after receiving my bill, I learned that Anthems staff provided me with incorrect information and that my mammogram was not covered as in-network and that the procedure went against my plan's deductible.

I paid premiums, and the coverage was very weak, and I paid more out of pocket than I expected. In 2017, I began receiving bills from providers that needed money back for claims that were paid by United Health Care in 2016. One afternoon, on July 10, 2017, I received a letter from UPMC of Pittsburgh Provider Business Services, date June 30th, stating that due to a Coordination of Benefits, I had to update my information with United Health Care in 5 business days. UPMC wouldn't return my calls, and I had to call United Health Care, and they informed me that I was covered by Cigna and they withdrew every claim they paid in 2016, beginning in 2017.  I then called Cigna, my previous insurer under an employer, and Cigna provided to me a letter of coverage that stated my coverage lapsed in October, 2015, because I opted out of COBRA due the excessive costs. One provider finally gave me a copy of the letter that United Health Care, deliberately falsified to recapture lost funds by their participation in the Affordable Care Act. They stated I was covered by Cigna from March 1, 2016 until December 31, 9998. I would be 8,024 years of age and still covered by Cigna. I then filed a formal complaint with the Better Business Bureau, and United Health Care had an external organization conduct the communications on their behalf. It's Optima conducting business, not United Health Care. A man named Mike ** called to tell me that they received the information from Cigna, but he refused to reply through the Better Business Bureau.

Perfect health is what I can claim. I was encouraged by United Healthcare 6 months ago to lower my premium by increasing my deductible. Within 6 months my premium went back up to what it was, + another $25. When I called to ask about this increase, they said there was nothing they could do. No explanation. No other program to offer me. Nothing. I am grandfathered in from an old Golden Rule premium. It is clear the United Healthcare and any other carrier will be looking to squeeze as much out of us on our current premium, or squeeze us out of a grandfathered program.  Six months ago, United Healthcare had an opportunity to help me with my premium, to make me a customer and build some trust. Instead, they chose to raise my deductible, save me $50 a month for 6 months, then come back and recoup the money 6 months later. I have no say in this. The rate is locked in for one year thanks to Obama Care and the thoughtlessness of the loopholes built for insurance companies.

The facility say that UHC said in their deny letter that I was not approved and the MRI was unnecessary. When I talked to UHC in October they were very pushy for me to have the MRI to find out if my DVT had moved from my leg to my pelvic area. Now when the results was ok they refuse to pay.

Specifically, they pay 30-35% the going cash pay rate in California. $60 per session (most therapists get $150 per session). Also, they refuse to pay the industry standard one hour session (90837), only agreeing to the 90834, or 35-45 min session, which is not what happens. Imagine if you only saw all clients for half hour sessions, and then told them it is all their insurance would allow. Clients often wonder why it is hard to find a therapist under their insurance, that is because they cannot keep the lights on if they took only insurance cases from companies like United. It is just wrong, and only the tip of the iceberg. Also noteworthy is, if they call you to discuss a case because you saw a mental health client once a week for 15-20 consecutive weeks, and you are unavailable to answer, they will send threatening letters to your clients, (scaring them) with disparaging comments about the clinician, and they will deny all claims for that client. Mental health clients are often in a fragile state, and do not need their irresponsible insurance carrier adding to their trauma. If this happens, and you try to call them back, they will then not take your call, and force your client to designate you as their delegate, and complete a 10 page document, before even considering re-opening your case, which they will then not pay retroactively. They have traumatized 4 of my clients, this year alone, in this way. DO NOT CONTRACT with them if you can avoid it at all.", "grade": "1", "extrac_date": "2022-04-04 08:37:42"},

Apparently, they don't believe anyone insured through them should or may have an emergency on weekends (or holidays, for that matter).

The day before the scheduled procedure, we were shocked to find out that it wasn't covered at AT ALL. Because of a previous colonoscopy some ten years' prior (different insurer) where they found and removed 4 polyps (he's had another clean colonoscopy before this last scheduled one), we were told that the procedure was deemed diagnostic and not preventative - therefore, they wouldn't cover it.

The thing is when he signed up (or failed to opt out) it was because his part of the premium was $0, free. Now the premium has gone up and he is being billed for the difference of what Medicare will pay and the new premium, which is almost triple what the initial enrollment amount was, yet he cannot opt out until open Enrollment in the fall. We would have opted out if we had known the premium could and would change. I will quote from a letter he received. \"A medicare beneficiary's silence is deemed to be consent to enrollment.\" Since the government covers part of this cost, if he does not pay his part, he will billed for the entire amount which is even higher, which they will tap out of his Disability social security.

For example, one medical provider showed me without revealing any patient information a recent and ongoing UHC prior authorization scheme where UHC had already given prior authorizations for a set period but denied authorization well before it expired then demanded prior authorizations for a different substitute medication, which after submitted and a lengthy approval period UHC just denied them outright, which clearly was their intent from the start.

He was having tonic-clonic seizures, often daily but at least 4 days a week. I cannot overstate what this does to a person. His cognitive abilities are not what they were before the seizures started. So it is fair to say that keeping control is paramount. The first problem was with UHC not covering an extended release version of **. They will cover the NON ER version for $5/month, but \"approved\" the ER for $300/month. Seriously??  One is dirt cheap and the other crazy high, that's hard to get my head around. The ER is preferred, so as to keep blood levels constant, especially because pharmacies often switch generics month to month. Next, they denied his **. Not placed it on highest tier, flat out denied it. (We were expecting a $150/month co pay on this.) This is the med that when was added to his other meds 5 years ago stopped his seizures. This will cost us $1000/month. Yes, we are appealing, so we will see what that brings. And yes, our son has been through most ALL epilepsy drugs which his epileptologist can document.

I called the United Health and they said that because I have a condition, family history of cancer and I'm not over 50 yrs old they won't pay for the procedure. They also said that when I'm 50 they still won't pay for it because I have a condition. I told the lady she was crazy because I have condition they would rather me not have the procedure done and wait until it's an emergency and they end up paying more! This is getting ridiculous... The same day I got a bill also for a MRI my neurologist ordered because I have a history of mini strokes. The bill was for $3400!

Then, even though my insurance plan said I was entitled to Chiropractic manipulation, they refused to assign me to a Chiropractor. I appealed and won the appeal. The UHC Appeals Supervisor said she couldn't understand why the Appeal had to even be filed and that my contract with UHC said I was entitled to 12 Chiropractic manipulations a year!

In the Fall of 2015, I told Dr. ** that I was changing at the beginning of 2016 to an Aetna PPO plan and asked her if she was a participating member with Aetna. She said she was, but advised me to double check with the front office staff to make sure. I did so and they clarified that she was a participating member of that particular plan and I would be able to keep her as my primary physician. I joined AETNA in 2016.

They said the marketplace (ObamaCare) did not send them over the payment I paid directly online. The marketplace said they did pay United Health Care premiums and they did not understand why it was not getting to my account properly. Luckily, I had not major issues with my health and so I ended up paying for insurance all year... But they just pocketed my money!  Going forward... 2016... was going to switch to Blue Cross, but my doctor was not covered under the plan so I was stuck with United Health Care as my only option. I decided to pay United Health Care directly each month for my premium payments. Well, March, I go to the doctor and have my mammo. Get letter and call that my health insurance was cancelled due to non payment again. They refused to pay the claim. 3 letters were sent out like this to my doctors as well as I was unable to get my prescription as they said I have no coverage, it had been cancelled.", "grade": "1", "extrac_date": "2022-04-04 08:37:47"},

They denied her benefit stating that she did not need nursing home care. Nobody at the nursing home agreed with this assessment. We appealed this having to go by their process. It took six months to complete this difficult process but we finally got our hearing in the firm. I had a conference call with an administrative law judge. I was very sure that I would win.  I did win but not in the manner that I expected. As soon as the hearing began the UHC representative conceded the case so I won without uttering a word on behalf of my mother-in-law.

The UHC physician denied the higher level of care without meeting with the patient. The safety of the patient with a history of TIA and seizures was determined by a physician hired by United Health Care without meeting with the patient for evaluation. I am concerned for the safety of patients who are being denied a level of care based on a review by a physician who has not met with the patient. This patient may be denied by a lower level of care due to the risk and liability of that risk. Insurance companies are profit oriented organizations but that should not put a patient with a serious medical condition at risk to have another stroke. My concern isn't a claim being denied due to that all claims paid diminish the profit of an insurance company. My concern is that due to profit, patients are at risk of being harmed.", "grade": "1", "extrac_date": "2022-04-04 08:37:49"},

They said that they would inform United Health Care that I was still eligible for the tax credit as long as I got the additional required documentation to them by August. I sent the required documentation immediately on May 22nd, 2015 so I wouldn't lose any coverage.  The next week I looked on my billing account from United Health Care and it still said that I did not have a tax credit and I owed the premium. I called UHC customer service and they said that they did not receive any documentation from the Marketplace saying that I had a tax credit even though when I looked on my account through the Marketplace, it clearly said that it did. I called the Marketplace and they told me that they have documentation that they sent UHC my updated information and that UHC should take care of it. I called UHC back and they said that because they didn't have documentation for May that I had a tax credit I owed the premium for May. I thought that that would be it and so I sent the additional $218.00 through my checking account as a one time payment thinking that my account would be corrected and I would be back on the right track. At that time I also paid my June payment with my credit card. ", "grade": "1", "extrac_date": "2022-04-04 08:37:51"},

They tell me they will fix it, but never do. After about 3 or 4 people done this, they put me through billing. Billing said they would have it fixed in three hours, and go back to get my medicine. I couldn't go back that day, because I had to go to school, so I had to wait until my pharmacy opened on Monday. So when I went to get it Monday, they still told me that I hadn't made my payments. I finally was tired of talking to everyone, so when I called again this Monday, I asked for a supervisor. He was worse than the regular employees. He didn't even try to go any deeper.

As soon as you need coverage for medical conditions they will find a way to not pay. They use terms like 'plan excluded' and 'not medically necessary' for every possible condition that arises! Just read all of the customer posts on UHC Facebook. Day after day customers complain about all the things UHC refuses to cover. My latest complaint... Vitamin B12 injections for B12 Deficiency and Pernicious Anemia are plan excluded by UHC. I was told by UHC rep that oral B12 would be covered instead. However, with Pernicious Anemia, oral B12 is not absorbed by the body and results in a deficiency that can cause neurological problems. Once again UHC has denied coverage for the services I need. We would be better off to have self-insured rather than pay the outrageous premiums to UHC which provides zero benefit.", "grade": "1", "extrac_date": "2022-04-04 08:37:52"},

When an item is denied there are two options a Peer to Peer Review or a formal appeal. The Peer to Peer review is when the client's prescribing MD calls UHC (UNITED HEALTH CARE) and speaks with the Medical Director to dispute the denial. This process has a time sensitive urgency which used to be 10-14 days after the denial. As of July 1st, 2015 UHC has implemented a new policy for the Peer to Peer review. UHC states The peer to peer must be conducted by 3 pm on the day the denial was provided. There are many issues with this.  First, many times we as providers do not receive a phone call notifying of denial. Often times we do not even receive a letter. And every once in awhile the client does not receive one on time, or at all. Secondly, UHC is demanding that an MD be available at a moments notice to dispute a denial. Everyone with common sense understands a medical doctor has several clients booked throughout the day with little in between time for much else. In my particular case we were not able to reach the client until 2:45 pm. The client did make an effort to call his MD however the clinic is closed on Tuesday's. How is this policy even legal? Never mind the fact that it's immoral and unethical. This policy should be illegal. This is not fair to consumers who pay for their coverage. Judges, lawyers, somebody PLEASE HELP!

They were \"in network\"? They almost have no specialty doctors \"in network\". Very frustrating when you have a child that needs to see a specialist. When they give you an \"in network\" doctor it's either a closed business or a doctor 50 miles away... They will not pay a doctors bill and claim that you were not covered then and when you call they say it was an error.

However, since I am a consumer and not a healthcare professional, I do not know what my health insurance company will plan to do when it comes to how my medication is handled. United Healthcare has my email address, my phone number, my mailing address, my work phone number, my work email, my work address. They know my coworkers because it's a small business of 10 employees and they know our account manager who chose United Healthcare, but they fail to make a single form of contact and have absolutely NO RESPECT for what happens when you stop medicating someone who is on a treatment program. Here's my track record and why United got a 1 star: Incident # 1: In 2014, United Healthcare stopped allowing me to fill my prescriptions in person at any pharmacy. They told me, they save money by shipping the medication in increments of 3 months. The medication I take is around $90 per bottle for a 30-day supply (with insurance) and about $600 or more without insurance. I found out on my very last pill, at the pharmacy, through several episodes of arguments with CVS and Walgreens that stated \"Your insurance rejected your medication\" and asked for half of my paycheck to pay for the medication. After that had ended, the insurance granted me a \"ONE-TIME-ONLY\" emergency fill of the medication, and I had 5 days to get a new prescription for 3 months put in a mailbox, and mailed 3000 miles away, to be filled by a pharmacy United Healthcare partnered with called OPTUMRX (and don't get me started on how ridiculous these people are).

UHC is THE worst insurance I have ever dealt with. Their reps are totally oblivious and incompetent in what the are doing. They bounce you around from one rep to another, most of them requesting the same information that you have provided before. So when it comes down to it, you end up having tons of emails, faxes, notes, etc. that you continually have to provide to each one because they conveniently can't see or don't have access to what the other has. We have a local rep that we are supposed to be able to contact when we have problems/questions but the majority of the time she replies \"refer to your contract\". We have been having ongoing issues with UHC not paying for a patients global (bundling) maternity care. There are times where a patient miscarries, transfers care or switches insurance. When that happens, then there are certain ways you have to bill insurance. UHC will deny claims when you bundle or unbundle. It doesn't matter which way you do it, UHC WILL find a way to deny it. On one patient you may unbundle and they will pay, but do the same for another patient it will be denied. No consistency on their part. And their supervisors/managers are worse than horrible when trying to get something resolved. In my opinion, those are the people who need to lose their jobs and be put out on the street (literally). I would say more about their supervisors/management, but there aren't any words that are bad enough for them. I'll give you just one example of a claim I am working on now. Just one of several. Patient delivered in Jan 2014, UHC paid for global maternity care. In June 2014, UHC took their money back because the policy was retro-termed back to Dec 2013. No problem, we just went ahead and billed delivery only to the secondary (which is now primary because UHC termed before delivery) and billed UHC for the prenatal visits. Things should be OK. Now it really gets bad. UHC denies the prenatal claim because it was past the 90 day filing limit. They said we have 90 days from the date of service to submit a claim. You see what just happened? We were notified in June 2014 that the policy retro-termed to Dec 2013.

We tried to follow all the rules by contacting them prior to receiving medical services and finding out exactly what our plan covered.

We were told that we would owe a co-pay for each session and that United Healthcare would cover the rest. It should have been a straightforward process. By way of explanation, the treatment is considered to be an out-patient office visit. For each medical treatment, the hospital submits three claims. One for the doctor's consultation, one by the hospital itself for the actual treatment, and one claim by the anesthesiologist. United Healthcare's first blunder was to treat the anesthesiologists as out-of-network, when, in fact, all of the anesthesiologists, but one, were in-network. UHC tried to apply the out-of-network deductible and out-of-network co-insurance. I had to call customer service. They changed the processing to in-network, but tried to charge in-network co-insurance, which they were not supposed to do. Second, they denied a claim, saying that we had other insurance. This was false, and I had to complain. Third, they improperly counted each of the three claims for each session as three different sessions. Thus, they were triple counting.

United refuses to assist in resolving this matter and had told me to just appeal the bill for the office visit. Aside from my disgust at their attitude that it is my problem to resolve and deal with, taking up my time and effort, I'm now left with no PCP while I have serious ongoing medical issues. I'm curious and hoping that other members may be filing a class action suit against United for their failure to appropriately notify patients and give them an opportunity to find new physicians while allowing for some temporary continuity of care.

So I again called UHC and spoke to a woman who had to transfer me because she could not access any of that information. Upon waiting almost 10 minutes, I was finally connected to another woman. This lady said that she did see the fax but that it was not sent over urgent and urgent faxes take 24 hours to process and routine take up to 5 days. I simply stated to her that well, since I was on the phone with her and I was the patient she could rectify the situation and approve the referral. She could give me the referral number so I could make the appointment. ", "grade": "1", "extrac_date": "2022-04-04 08:38:00"},

Here is a narrative of my brief, totally unsatisfactory experience with United Health Advantage since I took this plan in January 2013: Beginning soon after my plan became effective in January 2013, United Health sent reimbursement checks to my physical therapy provider instead of to me.

Clerks told me the forms were filled out wrong by the provider (a box indicating that the provider accepted assignment was left unchecked, which the provider said indicated the checks were to come to me). One man even insisted that providers never filed claims, leaving that job always to patients.

The company that I work for changed to United on 7/1/12 and it took them 3 months to get the deductible transferred from my Anthem account, so I had to pay out of pocket for everything until they figured it out. They eventually refunded some of it, but I still don't think the amount is correct. Try arguing with them, that's a dead-end street.", "grade": "1", "extrac_date": "2022-04-04 08:38:01"},

However, when we contacted UHC/Medco customer service, they at first could not explain the higher co-pay.  Finally, after doing some research, the CS rep indicated that her supervisor told her that we paid a higher co-pay because we did not comply with a UHC policy called the \"Adherence Incentive policy\".

We asked where that policy was published on the website, in the plan documents (SPD's) or on any of the prescription paperwork. The UHC CS rep then informed us that the policy was not written or any notice was published informing us of the terms.

At first, an amount of money was removed directly from my Social Security account monthly to pay for the insurance. As time went, the cost of the premium kept increasing until my monthly Social Security payment could not cover the amount of the bill. Social Security paid part and I was given an additional bill of over $100 a month. I soon realized that the cost of this insurance was excessively high and I no longer wanted to continue in this very expensive program. I called (telephone) and wrote letters asking to be removed from this insurance program, but I could get no response from United Health Care. I stopped paying their bills, thinking this would cause my insurance to lapse, just as it does in all of my other insurance policies.

Approve the diagnostic and then not let you have the procedure. Im still in severe back pain. They are a horrible insurance company. They dont even pay very much to these doctors. It wouldnt hurt them a bit. They dont care that their patients are in pain. All they care about is the almighty dollar. Big business ************* companies-are so messed up, it needs to just be dismantled and start over again. When an insurance company tells you what you do and do not need and override your doctor with multiple degrees and tons of experience,, that is just wrong..
